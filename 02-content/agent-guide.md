# Agent Guide

## Summary

**Agent Guide** is Birkly’s structured context layer for AI systems and connected agents. It sits on top of your existing CMS content, Media library, and other canonical sources — it does **not** replace them. You declare **sources of truth** first, then build concise summaries (identity, offerings, claims, voice), and **publish** a versioned, machine-readable snapshot on your **public site domain** so agents, crawlers, and integrations can discover and use it responsibly.

Works for individuals, teams, enterprises, nonprofits, and any site that wants a single authoritative guide for automated assistants.

**Product promise:** Publish an authoritative, structured, evidence-aware representation that is easier for AI systems to discover and use. This is **not** a guarantee that every AI model will ingest your guide, and it is **not** a chatbot builder.

## What problem does it solve?

When someone asks an assistant “What does this organization do?” or “Is their offering a good fit for small teams?”, the answer often comes from scattered pages, outdated summaries, or guesswork. Agent Guide gives you one place to:

1. **Declare sources of truth** — CMS entries, websites, documents, media, marketplaces — where agents should read first.
2. **Curate** the story you want AI to tell (identity, positioning, products, voice).
3. **Ground** that story in evidence (URLs, certifications, review pages, CMS refs).
4. **Publish** a versioned JSON snapshot agents can read without scraping your whole site.
5. **Link** summaries to deeper sources so agents know where to verify details.

Think of Agent Guide as the **index and authority map** — not the full encyclopedia.

**Draft vs published:** All edits save to a **draft**. Public endpoints serve the **published** snapshot only until you publish again. Iterate safely without affecting what agents see.

## Recommended workflow

Follow the admin workflow strip on the Overview tab:

1. **Sources** — Declare where agents should read the truth (start here).
2. **Context** — Identity, positioning, terminology, relationships.
3. **Products & Services** — Structured catalog with source links.
4. **Claims & Evidence** — Factual statements and proof.
5. **Publish** — Enable endpoints, preview, go live.

Summaries in Context and Products should **reflect** your declared sources — not invent parallel truth.

## Where to find it

Admin sidebar → **Agent Guide** (between Media and Marketplace).

**URLs:** `/admin/?page=agent-guide` (legacy alias: `?page=ai-presence`).

**Permissions:**

| Action | Permission |
|--------|------------|
| View Agent Guide | `read` |
| Edit, publish | `manage_settings` |

## Admin tabs (at a glance)

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Overview** | Completeness score, source health, CMS sync drift, link checks, public URLs |
| **Sources** | `sources_of_truth[]` registry — CMS, websites, documents, media, marketplaces |
| **Context** | Identity, positioning, terminology, relationships |
| **Products & Services** | Structured catalog with typed source links |
| **Claims & Evidence** | Factual statements, proof sources, review workflow |
| **Media** | Per-asset context (what it represents, intended use, restrictions) |
| **Publish** | Enable publishing, version history, staleness warnings, AI preview |

## AI Assist sidebar

The sticky save bar and right-hand **AI Assist** panel help you fill gaps without auto-saving:

- **Auto-fill / Fill gaps / Fill 100%** — AI suggestions you approve one-by-one or in bulk
- **Suggest sources / cross-links** — Propose `sources_of_truth` entries, product→CMS links, evidence URLs
- **Guide Studio** (Advanced) — Multi-collection wizard from CMS sources
- Per-field **Generate** on Context fields — Targeted suggestions applied directly to the field

Suggestions are **never auto-saved** until you accept them. AI Assist prefers declared **sources of truth** before inferring.

## Quick start (5 steps)

1. **Sources** — Add at least one **narrative** source of truth (CMS entry, website, or document).
2. **Context** — Official name, short description; link summaries to sources via `derived_from` where helpful.
3. **Products** — Add at least one product/service with a **canonical source link** (CMS entry or public URL).
4. **Claims** — Add 2–3 factual claims; attach evidence with verifiable URLs; mark reviewed claims as **Supported**.
5. **Publish** — Enable publishing, click **Publish**, verify `/.well-known/agent-guide.json` on your public domain.

Full walkthrough: [Getting started](agent-guide-getting-started.md).

## What gets published

Published JSON (`agent_guide.v1`; legacy exports may show `ai_presence.v1`) includes:

- **`sources_of_truth[]`** — Resolved registry of canonical sources
- **`guide_meta`** — Product marker and summary-layer hints
- **identity**, **positioning**, **communication_guidance**
- **products_services[]** with resolved **`sources[]`** (public URLs)
- **claims[]** with **evidence** and optional direct **sources[]**
- **media_context**, **relationships**
- **`usage_hints`** — Guidance for AI consumers (authoritative vs marketing fields; follow sources of truth)
- **`identity.derived_from`** — Which sources ground summary fields
- Optional **`json_ld`** — Schema.org graph (Organization, Product/Service, Claim)

Legacy field **`connected_content[]`** is migrated into `sources_of_truth[]` on save.

## FAQ

**Does Agent Guide replace my About page or product CMS entries?**  
No. Content stays in Content; Agent Guide references and summarizes for agents.

**Why sources of truth first?**  
Agents need a declared reading order. Summaries without sources invite hallucination; the registry tells consumers where to verify.

**Will ChatGPT automatically use my guide?**  
Not guaranteed. You make discovery easier via well-known JSON, public API, and JSON-LD. Adoption depends on crawlers, integrations, and MCP-connected tools.

**Can I hide draft work from the public?**  
Yes. Only **published** snapshots are public. Disable publishing or don’t publish until ready.

**Do I need AI connections configured?**  
No. Rule-based suggestions and manual editing work without AI. Connections unlock Copilot, Fill 100%, and smarter suggestions.

**Do I need a vector database?**  
No. Agent Guide is **curated truth + evidence + source links** — the right model for “what is officially true about our brand?” Vector search helps **fuzzy search over huge unstructured archives** (e.g. support tickets). That is a different product problem; optional semantic search could be a **future plugin**, not core CMS.

**Legacy paths and tools?**  
`/.well-known/brand-context.json`, MCP `get_brand_context`, and admin `?page=ai-presence` remain supported as aliases.
